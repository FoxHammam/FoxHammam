## About me :
-I’m a passionate full-stack web developer who enjoys building complete web applications from concept to deployment. I love working on both the front end and back end, turning ideas into functional, clean, and user-friendly experiences.

- I spend a lot of my time building side projects to strengthen my skills, experiment with new technologies, and solve real-world problems through code. Developing programs and working on practical projects helps me learn faster and understand how things work behind the scenes.

- I’m constantly learning and improving, whether it’s writing better code, understanding system design, or exploring new tools and frameworks. I enjoy challenges, problem-solving, and the process of breaking complex ideas into simple, efficient solutions.

- My goal is to keep growing as a developer, build meaningful projects, and continuously push myself to become better in full-stack development while staying curious and motivated.
